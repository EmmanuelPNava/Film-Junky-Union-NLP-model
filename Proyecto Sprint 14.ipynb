    "---\n",
    "Film Junky Union, una nueva comunidad vanguardista para los aficionados de las películas clásicas, está desarrollando un sistema para filtrar y categorizar reseñas de películas. Nuestro objetivo es entrenar un modelo para detectar las críticas negativas de forma automática. Para lograrlo, utilizaremos un conjunto de datos de reseñas de películas de IMDB con leyendas de polaridad para construir un modelo para clasificar las reseñas positivas y negativas. Este deberá alcanzar un valor F1 de al menos 0.85."

just fantastic it be so original and so entertain the screenplay itself write by david and janet people be inspire by a movie name la jet e which I have not see but I must thank the director and writer of the movie chris marker for give such an inspiration for the writer of twelve monkey I read a little about la jet e it be not the same story but it have the same idea so this be not just a copy of it david and janet people have transform this great deal of inspiration to a modernize story which tell about this urgent need for people to find a solution for maintain human existence and it do it in a so beautiful and a realistic way that it be a guarantee thrill ride from the beginning till the end the music use in the film be odd and somehow so funny and amusing it do not really fit until you really get it and when you do you realise that it be so compelling compose by paul buckmaster terry gilliam who we remember from monty python as the director of the movie be a real surprise for I as I really never think he as a director type of a person I know he have direct movie before but I really could not believe that he could make something this magnificent it should not be a surprise though as he do an amazing job you can still sense that same weirdness as in the python 's but for I the directing be pretty much flawless though in its odd way of describe thing it also make some scene strangely disturb yes it be indeed odd weird bizarre and disturb so it also make the movie a bit heavy too so the weak minded viewer will probably find it hard to watch the movie all the way through it be not as heavy as you could imagine but it just have these certain thing which in their own purpose be sometimes pretty severe to watch despite that the movie hold this pure intelligence inside it and through flashback dream jump between the past and the future it mix up the whole story in a very clever way and it do not even make the plot messy in any part though it do need concentration from the viewer after all what come to act well the movie do not even go wrong there the role of james cole be play by the mighty bruce willis who probably do his good role performance yet to date now people may disagree with I as he do some fine job in for example the sixth sense as well but for I the role of james cole be so ideal for willis and he perform it incredibly well the character be very well write too yet perform even well cole start to question his own existence and he deal with himself start to question his actual time of living try to survive and find the crucial missing piece of the puzzle by hardship he start to loose his faith question if he can even trust or believe himself other role performance worth mention be the performance of madeleine stow and brad pitt stow play the role of kathryn railly the psychiatrist of james cole who see something strangely familiar in cole and decide to help he to deal with his madness she somehow start to believe cole 's story but as a believer of science she try to find solution through it and try to deal with reason when it come to unbelievable thing brad pitt be so good in the role of jeffrey goines and he also do one of his good role performance yet to date the insane yet hilarious personality of the character bring pitt even an oscar nomination for it so I guess I be not praise the honestly fabulous performance for nothing all in all twelve monkey be a great science fiction experience and it will surely be a recommendation for everyone especially for the sci fi fan it include brilliant character and superb role performance especially from willis and pitt and an original and an entertaining story which form a plot that be so intelligent and clever yet be that already mention weird and disturb it definitely capture the viewer 's attention by make it interesting and witty it be also an explosive thriller and it have romance in it too so it be all that in

fantastic idea about the nature of time I especially love the idea one can not change the past it be a nice counterpoint to so many time travel movie which say otherwise biological holocaust and the thin line between sanity and madness gilliam visualize his idea with unique quirkiness perfection and originality the story itself be engage one man james cole play by bruce willis in a heart warming performance travel several decade to the past to retrieve information about a virus that be wipe out mankind and leave only a few survivor alive live underground with the information he will collect scientist hope to find a cure so everyone in the future can return to the surface but because their time travel technology be not perfect he end up be send towards different other past and complicate thing and from that a brilliant science fiction thriller with shade of film noir ensue as the multiple piece of a huge jigsaw start fit together to form a bizarre narrative involve animal right activist end of the millennium paranoia biological weapon the perception of reality and the definition of sanity with such a complex movie it be easy for gilliam and people to create a mess but instead twelve monkey be a thought provoke narrative which will please those who like to be challenge and have patience to appreciate some crazy idea I watch this movie once around year ago it mark I a lot I remember still think about many day after ward for my young mind this seem quite mind blow and it be one of the first movie to make I appreciate cinema as something serious and important I have re watch this movie a few day ago on dvd and it be well than I remember it brad pitt still steal all the scene he be in play jeffrey goine almost a prelude to his tyler durden character in fight club a rich kid with some anarchist non conformist idea who be also crazy and accord to cole perhaps responsible for the virus the scene between jeffrey and cole in the madhouse be the good in the movie pitt 's eye voice and quirky mannerism convince you he be really a crazy guy lock in a warped logic only he understand pitt 's oscar nomination be well deserve surprising be also bruce willis ' performance his I do not remember very well but it be beautiful and full of sensibility he play a man who spend almost all his life underground and when he come to the past you will share his childish fascination with something as simple as breathe the fresh air of the morning or watch the sun go up cole be a rather ambiguous character people ' try to imbue some darkness in he and he do other disturb thing to other people and to himself the scene where he remove his own tooth reveal how far his dementia have go unchecked ironically cole do not start as a crazy character but when he start warn everyone about the end of the world he be consider mad and convince it be all in his mind until he arrive at a point when he can not distinguish past from future reality from fiction willis spend a lot of time look confused and insecure and it work perfectly one of the fun twist in the narrative be when cole 's shrink dr kathryn railly find undeniable proof he be really from the future and now have to convince he again of his mission to save the world the screenplay be full with weird twist like this and it keep the movie in a fast pace their relationship be also well handed although perhaps a bit compress for time 's sake but I enjoy watch cole and railly fall in love and try to escape the authority of the future to live a peaceful life in the past but then thing end in a tragic bittersweet climax at an airport wrap all the piece together which will blow many mind away there be two great ending in this movie a twist in the sense of se en or fight club and a more intimate end where railly be crouch next to cole who be just be shoot and look around for a young james cole who be witness his future self die the two share a brief look and she smile at he the twist be brilliant but I prefer this ending for emotional impact madeleine stowe be very good playing dr railly she draw many different emotion from I in her performance the movie be fill with a sense of fatalism with the idea the past can not be change this movie show that in a terrifying way it remind I of chinatown in that sense the way jake gitte mess everything up the more he try to help railly 's character share that fatalism the more she try to help cole first deal with his ' madness ' then help he in his mission the more they be suck into tragedy the twist end with a hopeful note though with the feel cole 's mission have not be in vain twelve monkey be a great movie to watch if one want to be entertain it be not suppose to be art although it be more artist than many artistic movie it be an unpretentious movie where all element from music to edit to costume design etc come together beautifully to produce a modern cinema masterpiece\",\n",

with this thought and a mild sense of embarrassment that I have not watch the complete film early I watch this film last saturday there be some start similarity with other work like the legendary mulholland drive david lynch from which this film borrow at least concept a that at least some truth be relative b the first scene of shabana and konkonam go around in a car as the opening credit roll be uncannily similar to the car ride that betty and rita undertake in mulholland drive in both case the object of inquiry happen to be a place which be probably mythical in both case and perhaps more openly symbolic in aparna 's film c the incident revolve around the mad beggar woman be again extremely reminiscent of the whole ' occurence behind winkie ' involve a bum but while that scary creature be an embodiment of something and that that ' something ' as well as the character per se be seamlessly link to other work of lynch notice carefully the dishevel long hair the effect of the beggar woman in pa appear to be a tribute and therefore insignificant in the context of the film and its message the other film from which pa also borrow be blow up especially the last scene be a throw back to the truth vs perceive truth poser present towards the end of antonioni 's masterpiece of course the professor and schizophrenia angle also bring to the mind a beautiful mind although admittedly the subject here be high brow physics and shabana who profess it inadvertently end up be the brilliant antithesis to the delusional hallucination of konkona 's character through those very prophecy in an outstanding scene in the movie some of these element be juxtapose with each other and that scene cut back and forth from the ' real ' world of shabana where quantum physics and the theory of relativity justify the finiteness and composition of the universe to the artificial edifice of the ' make believe ' world of mithi but for all their difference the sister be alike too both be incapable of form long last relationship one out of choice and the other out of nature so mithi 's pain at be reject in love by joydeep be in harmony with the inability of shaban to form a special bond with either kunal dhritiman or sanjeev kanwaljeet but I be get ahead of myself viewer generally tend to view this film in one of the follow two way hypothesis it be shabana all along there be a certain section of the audience who think so but that explanation be not only too far fetched but also contrive as that would mean she be dream up so many other character too I e all those character whom she visualize as visualize mithi along with her hypothesis there be a real mithi and the ending be a metaphor this pov say that the film 's essence be summarize in one dialog in the film when in response to a statement by joy rahul bose that mithi be look for something that she will never find his wife laxmi shefali shah philosophize that we all be look indeed for that illusive utopia the end of the rainbow wherein appear to lie the mirage of happiness and contentment there be other more minor possibility which have not be embrace that much by our knowledgeable audience like hypothesis shabana and konkona be alter egos of the same person hypothesis shabana too be a figment of mithi 's imagination hypothesis the old haggard perhaps mad beggar woman be the real protagonist of the story be these hypothesis worthy of even be test well your guess be as good as mine why park avenue contrary to the popular perception that she be think of the park avenue in ny I believe that she get the name from the brand name of a semi popular bathing soap remember she state jo jo 's profession as prime minister of shikakai which as you may be know be a popular ingredient use in manufacture shampoo the prefix ' ' be use as it be on th december that mithi get engage to joydeep and after his walkout she remain forever in a time warp the film have its fair share of flaw lack of use of a strong background score which in film like these can really augment the narrative some sloppy dialog unabate by some force dialog delivery inconsistent performance shabana and dhritimaan be excellent though imo by a few of the cast member albeit many member of this ensemble cast have be waste shefali chaya 's sudden insecurity about her husband seem to be an unimaginatively introduce dimension in the plot I give it as it make I think but not any high than that because I can easily fathom its source of inspiration and have experience and for the most part thoroughly enjoy those previously I have already think on similar line early so the experience post pa be bind to be san a certain degree of novelty where be I come from I give to ' chowringhee lane ' though rumor still persist that one

we walk out of the film with an equally warm feeling and a sense of satisfaction derivative of only high calibre film production it be only pixar 's second animate feature the sub group of disney make their spectacular debut and perhaps entirely inadvertent mark on the film world three year prior in with their landmark movie toy story it be a movie which defy convention re invent and breathe new life into animation and define a whole new level of excellence now they return with their sophomore effort which to be honest draw a creeping sense of cynicism in we all prior to see the film after all it be a film about ant well all walk of the insect and bug world be cover in a bug 's life but it be the ant which be the focal point in this film as human be the focal point in dramas romance and so on how can such an insignificant specie of animal such as an ant act as the protagonist of a movie let alone provide the entire premise of a feature film surely they jest however we forget that in toy story a bunch of toy box item be able to become the grandest most inspiring and lovable bunch of animate hero and villain ever concoct the guy at pixar manage to pull off the same feat and manage to turn a bunch of dirty and miniscule bug into the most endearing and pleasant gang of vermin you will probably ever encounter not only be they all entirely amiable and likable there be not an unpleasant character in sight even the villain be rivet character but they be colourful they be eclectic and they be idiosyncratic and the array of character be also gargantuan for lack of a well term only add the rich layer of distinctiveness already plaster onto a bug 's life from the beginning we shall start with our main character and our hero his name be flik david foley and his character be rather generic to say the least out of the thousand of faithful and obedient worker ant reside on the lush beautiful ant island he be the one consider the ' black sheep ' of the clan as see in the opening moment of the movie when he inadvertently destroy the season 's harvest with his antic the problem arise in the fact that the ant ' harvest be for a bunch of greedy grasshopper lead by hopper kevin spacey who be eager to continue to assert their wrath and autocracy amongst the puny little ant when they show up to ant island for their annual banquet and see that their offering be go they go insane for lack of a well term hopper offer a proposition to save the ant from total extinction at his pack 's hand however it be a negotiation which be simply impossible to fulfil the cog and clockwork in flik 's mind run at full steam now despite his guilt and shame and he offer to leave ant island in search of some mighty bug warrior who can come to the colony 's rescue and fight off hopper and the grasshopper if you think about it a bug 's life bear some heavy resemblance to the plot line 's of akira kurosawa 's classic seven samurai or the american remake the magnificent seven in which a village of hapless but good hearted folk be threaten by malevolent and wicked enemy one lone village dweller go in search for help in the big city find it and return to the colony to drive off evil in a bug 's life the help come in the form of a down and out circus troupe who be mistakenly perceive by flik as warrior in a bar room brawl much amusement come out of these scene and much amusement come out of these circus troupe bug among they be an erudite stick insect david hyde pierce a side split obese german caterpillar by the name of heimlich and a quasi femme fatale ladybug who be in fact a gritty and masculine ladybug dennis hopper it be exceedingly enjoyable watch these bug on screen as it be watch the bug and the insect interact on screen as be the entire movie collectively as I have say much amusement and mirth come out of their character and joyous interaction with one another which give way to a bevy of hilarious line wonderfully suspenseful and riveting situation and overall a dazzling movie what make a bug 's life even well be that the film be not restrict simply to child as many may perceive it to be although child would indeed find more entertainment out of this film the clich d kid friendly situation be a bit more abundant than we would like however it be easy to ignore this fault and it be incredulously easy to enjoy this film although a bug 's life may not reach the dizzying and landmark standard set by its predecessor this be still a superb movie and the start of something promise here pixar have prove that they be not just a one hit wonder but instead a much gifted and talented group of film artist in hollywood they raise the bar endlessly and when someone always manage to top their standard it be only always by themselves what more be there to say about a bug 's life other than see it it be not quite the good which we have see from the folk at emeryville california but this beat out the lot of its year and I

El primer modelo cuenta con 2 VP, 4 VN, y 2 FN, mientras que el segundo tiene en total 4 VP, 2 VN, y 2 FP. Tal parece que mientras uno se inclina hacia las reseñas negativas, otro tiene su peso en las reseñas positivas. \n",
